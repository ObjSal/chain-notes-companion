"""Local companion server for prime-chain-notes.

Serves the static companion page AND — when a node is configured — exposes
a **remote** Bitcoin Core node (regtest or testnet4; reached over an SSH
tunnel or the tailnet, never spawned locally) through a **mempool.space-
shaped API** at /node/api/*. That's the improvement over the
bitcoin-gift-wallet pattern this borrows from: the page needs no special-
casing beyond a base-URL map, because the shim speaks the same dialect as
https://mempool.space/api (esplora-style endpoints + /v1/fees, /v1/prices).

/regtest/api/* is a **permanent alias** for /node/api/* — historical name
(this server used to manage its own throwaway regtest node), kept forever
because it's a wire contract with index.html, chain-scan.js, viewer.html,
note.html and every suite. Both prefixes always answer identically.

Usage:
    python3 server.py [port]                                # static only (page hides the node)
    python3 server.py [port] --node HOST:PORT --network NET  # NET = regtest | testnet4

--node/--network fall back to the CN_NODE_HOST/CN_NODE_PORT/CN_NETWORK
environment variables when the flags are absent. CORE_RPC_USER and
CORE_RPC_PASS are ALWAYS read from the environment, never from a flag —
see ../../ui-automation/node-env.sh, which decrypts the Pi's RPC
credentials for a given network and execs a command with all five of
these exported. This file is part of a PUBLIC repo: it must never read
../private/ or print a credential value.

CN_WATCH_WALLET (env only, no flag) overrides the bitcoind wallet this
server watches addresses through — default "chain-notes-watch", the
wallet shared by every suite and every run on the Pi. A harness run
should instead pass its OWN unique per-run wallet name (see
ui-automation/node-suite-lib.sh) so `listtransactions "*"` in
address_txids() below stays O(this run's handful of addresses) instead of
O(every address any suite has ever watched). The miner wallet name is
NOT configurable — it's ours, never shared, no cost problem to fix.

Stdlib only. GET  /api/health                       → {"status":"ok","network":...,"node":"host:port","regtest":bool}
             GET  /node/api/blocks/tip/height                  (alias: /regtest/api/...)
             GET  /node/api/address/A[?new=1]            → esplora-style chain_stats/mempool_stats
             GET  /node/api/address/A/txs[/chain][?after_txid=T][&new=1]
             GET  /node/api/address/A/utxo[?new=1]
             GET  /node/api/v1/fees/recommended
             GET  /node/api/v1/prices
             POST /node/api/tx                 (regtest: auto-mines 1 block after accept)
             POST /node/api/mine?blocks=N      (regtest only — 409 on testnet4, you cannot mine there)
             POST /node/api/faucet             {"address": A, "amount": btc}  (regtest only)

`?new=1` on an /address route is an opt-in hint that the address has NEVER
been used — the caller (e.g. a suite that just derived a fresh per-run
identity) is asserting there is no history to find. It imports the watch
descriptor at timestamp "now" instead of 0, which bitcoind treats as "no
rescan needed" (see ensure_address_watched). Default (no `new`, or `new=0`)
is unchanged: timestamp 0, a real rescan, because restore/recovery flows
depend on finding genuinely historical addresses. Getting this wrong for
an address that DOES have history silently hides it — only pass it when
you are certain.
